	<h1>Healthy eating</h1>
	<p>Eating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health, and can help you feel your best.
This means eating a wide variety of foods in the right proportions, and consuming the right amount of food and drink to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.</p>

	<h1>Food groups in our diet</h1>
	<p>
The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to:
eat 5 A DAY
base meals on starchy foods like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta
have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks)
eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein
choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts
drink plenty of fluids
If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.
Try to choose a variety of different foods from the five main food groups. Most people in the UK eat and drink too many calories, too much fat, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish or fibre.

	<h1>Not getting tired of eating healthy</h1>
	<p>If you get tired from eating healthy easily you need to start getting different foods into your menu not every healthy thing is awful tasting.You can start with eating the usual white rice with some veggies and add different spices to it and make it so taste you'll eat it whole week haha.
		And the good thing for me in dieting is that you can eat meat and its very helpful for your muscle growth.
